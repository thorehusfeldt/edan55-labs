\section{Maximum Cut}
Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with positive edge weights
$w(e)$ $(e\in E)$.
Set $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$.
The Maximum Cut problem (Maxcut) is to find a partition of the
vertices with the largest total weight of the edges ``crossing'' the
partition, i.e., maximising the value of \[c(A)= \sum_{(u,v)\in E,
  u\in A, v\notin A} w(u,v)\,\] over all $A\subseteq V$.

Maxcut is NP-hard, so we have little hope of writing an algorithm that
solves arbitrary Maxcut instances optimally.

\subsection{ Algorithm R}

Consider the following simple randomized algorithm (call it
Algorithm~R): Let $A$ be a \emph{random subset} of $V$ constructed by
flipping a coin $r(v)\in\{0,1\}$ for every vertex $v\in V$ and setting
$v\in A$ if and only if $r(v)=1$.

\subsection{Inputs}
The  data directory contains two input instances:
\begin{description}
\item[ pw09\_100.9.txt:] A random instance with $|V|=100$ and
  $|E|=4455$. The best cut in this instance is
  13658.\sidenote{A. Wiegele, Biq Mac Library - A collection of Max-Cut
    and quadratic 0-1 programming instances of medium size, 2007.}
\item[ matching\_1000.txt:] A disjoint union of 500 edges with unit weight.
\end{description}

The input format is straightforward: the first line contains $n$ and
$m$; every following line describes an edge in the format first
vertex, second vertex, weight.
All weights are integers, vertices are numbered $1,2,\ldots, n$.

\subsection{Algorithm G}
Consider the following simple greedy algorithm (call it 
Algorithm~G): Let all the verticies be outside of $A$ to begin with.
A vetrex can be flipped, which means that if it's outside of $A$ its moved into
$A$ and if its inside $A$ its moved out of $A$.
Pick the first vertex you can find that increases your cut if flipped.
Flip this vetrex, and continue doing so until no vertex increases the cut
if flipped, eg you find a local maxima.

\subsection{Algorithm RS}
Consider the following simple randomized swapping algorithm (call
it Algorithm~RS): Combine Algorithm R and G by instead of placing
all vertices outside of $A$ to begin with in G, place the verticies according
to the output of R. Then proceed with the flipping part of G.

\subsection{ Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement algorithm R, G and RS and run it on the dataset provided in
  the data directory.
  Use whatever programming language and libraries you want, but make
  sure that your code is short and crisp; Each of the algorithms should 
  not be much more than 20 lines. Reading input + scoring should also be
  small. Making all the code together less than 100 lines is a suitable goal.
  Attach a printout of the code to the report.
\item Fill out the report on the next page; you can just use the
  \LaTeX\ code if you want.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Analysis of performance guarantee}

Clearly, Algorithm R performs quite badly on input 
  matching\_1000.txt.
We will show that it can perform \emph{no worse} than that, i.e., we
will establish that in expectation, the cutsize $C$ satisfies $C \geq
[\ldots]\cdot \operatorname{OPT}$.\sidenote{Replace [\ldots] by the
  right constant}


We will view $C$ as a random variable that gives the size of the cut
defined by the random choices.
Let $W$ denote the total weight of the edges of $G$, i.e.,
\[ W= \sum_{e\in E} w(e)\,.\]

Then,
\begin{equation}\label{eq: E[C]}
E[C] = \textstyle\frac{1}{2}\cdot W\,.
\end{equation}

To see this, define the indicator random variable $X_{uv}$ for every
edge $uv\in E$ as follows.
Set $X_{uv}=1$ if $uv$ crosses the cut, i.e., $u\in A$ and $v\notin A$
or $u\notin A$ and $v\in A$.
Otherwise, $X_{uv} = 0$.

Then, $\Pr(X_{uv} = 1) = [\ldots]$.
Now, $E[C]=[\ldots]$ Finally, we have 
\(E[C]\geq [\ldots]\cdot \text{OPT}\) because clearly
$[\ldots]$.\sidenote{Fill in the missing blanks in this paragraph.
  Your calculations and arguments need to include phrases like
  ``because BLA and BLA are independent'' or ``disjoint,'' and ``by
  linearity of expectation'' and ``because the weights are positive.''

\section{Optional: Derandomising Algorithm R}

\subsection{Algorithm L} 


We now reduce the number of random bits used by the algorithm to $\log
n$ using a simple \emph{pseudorandom generator}.


Let $k=\lceil\log (n+1)\rceil$ and flip $k$ coins $b_1,\ldots, b_k$.
There are $2^k -1 \geq n$ different ways of choosing a nonempty subset
$S\subseteq [k]$ of the coins.
Each of these ways defines a random bit $r_S =\bigoplus_{i\in S} b_i$.
(Here, $\oplus$ denotes exclusive or.)
This gives a total of $n$ random bits.
These random bits are not as high-quality as the original $k$ bits,
but they retain the crucial property of \emph{pairwise independence}:
If $S\neq T$ then
\[ \Pr(r_S\neq r_T) = [\ldots],.\]

Extend Algorithm~R using this idea; call the resulting
algorithm~L (for logarithmic randomness).

\subsection{Algorithm Z}

For our final trick, we let the random bits disappear completely:
since Algorithm~L uses only $k$ bits of randomness, we can iterate
over \emph{all} coin flips---there are only $2^k$, which is polynomial
(in fact, linear) in $n$.
Extend algorithm~L using this idea; call the resulting algorithm~Z
(for zero randomness).
The running time of Z is $O([\ldots])$.

\section{Perspective}

This lab establishes minimal skills in algorithms implementation,
probabilistic analysis of algorithms (independence, linearity of
expectation, and in particular the trick of computing an expectation
using indicator random variables), and approximation guarantees (in
particular, finding upper and lower bounds by exhibiting a concrete
``bad instance'' and a comparison to a hypothetical optimum,
respectively).
The histogram aims to establish the intuition that measure is
concentrated around its expectation.

To establish that Maxcut is NP-hard one reduces from NAE-Sat, a
reduction that can be found in many places\sidenote{C. Moore and
S. Mertens, \emph{The Nature of Computation}, Oxford University Press,
  2011, p. 146.}
Recall that the related problem \emph{Minimum Cut} is easy because of
the max flow--min cut theorem.
A moment's thought should convince you that as soon as negative
weights are allowed, the two problems are the same (and both are
hard).
Algorithm R doesn't work at all for negative weights.

Algorithm R is a classical randomised approximation algorithm, its
origins seem to be shrouded in the mists of time.
The \emph{deterministic} algorithm of Sahni and Gonzales\sidenote{S.\
  Sahni and T.\ Gonzalez.
  P-complete approximation problems.
  \emph{J.\ Assoc.\ Comput.\ Mach.}, 23(3):555--565, 1976.}
can be viewed as a derandomisation of R using the \emph{method of
  conditional expectations}.
These algorithms were best knows until the breakthrough result of
Goemans and Williamson,\sidenote{M.\ X.\ Goemans and D.\ P.\
  Williamson.
  Improved approximation algorithms for maximum cut and satisfiability
  problems using semidefinite programming.
  \emph{J.\ Assoc.\ Comput.\ Mach.}, 42(6):1115--1145, 1995.}
which improved the approximation factor to $0.87856$.
H\aa{}stad has shown that no algorithm can approximate the maxcut
better than $16/17\sim 0.941176$ unless P equals NP. Khot has shown
that the Goemans--Williamson bound is essentially optimal under the
\emph{Unique Games Conjecture}.

Algorithm L can also be viewed as an application of \emph{pairwise
  independent hash functions}.
