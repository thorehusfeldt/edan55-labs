  \medskip\noindent Bob maintains a complete binary tree of height
  $h>1$ with $N=2^h-1$ nodes called $1,\ldots, N$.
  Nodes are in one of two states: marked or unmarked; initially, all
  nodes are unmarked.
  Each round Alice sends an integer $i\in \{1,\ldots, N\}$ according
  to a random process specified below.
  Bob marks node $i$ in his tree.
  Bob then uses the following marking rules repeatedly:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An internal node gets marked when both its children are marked,
  so $\vcenter{\hbox{\begin{tikzpicture}[inner sep = 2pt, every
        node/.style={draw,circle}] \node[fill=gray] (u) at (0,0) { };
        \node[fill=gray] (v) at (.5,0) { }; \node (w) at (.25,.3) { };

  \draw[-] (w) edge (u);
  \draw[-] (w) edge (v);
\end{tikzpicture}}}$
becomes
$\vcenter{\hbox{\begin{tikzpicture}[inner sep = 2pt, every node/.style={draw,circle}]
  \node[fill=gray] (u) at (0,0) { };
  \node[fill=gray] (v) at (.5,0) {  };
  \node[fill=gray] (w) at (.25,.3) {  };

  \draw[-] (w) edge (u);
  \draw[-] (w) edge (v);
\end{tikzpicture}}}$.

\item A non-root node gets marked if its parent and sibling are
  marked, so
$\vcenter{\hbox{\begin{tikzpicture}[inner sep = 2pt, every node/.style={draw,circle}]
  \node[fill=gray] (u) at (0,0) { };
  \node (v) at (.5,0) {  };
  \node[fill=gray] (w) at (.25,.3) {  };

  \draw[-] (w) edge (u);
  \draw[-] (w) edge (v);
\end{tikzpicture}}}$
becomes
$\vcenter{\hbox{\begin{tikzpicture}[inner sep = 2pt,every node/.style={draw,circle}]
  \node[fill=gray] (u) at (0,0) { };
  \node[fill=gray] (v) at (.5,0) {  };
  \node[fill=gray] (w) at (.25,.3) {  };

  \draw[-] (w) edge (u);
  \draw[-] (w) edge (v);
\end{tikzpicture}}}$
and similarly for a left child.
\end{enumerate}
Bob applies these rules as often as possible, often leading to a
cascade of markings.
When no more rules apply, this round ends. 
For instance, if Alice sends ``5'' in the figure to the right then the
entire tree gets marked in this round.
\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw,circle}]
  \node (1)[fill=gray] at (1.5,1.4)  { 1 };
  \node (2) at (.5,.8)  { 2 };
  \node (3) at (2.5,.8) { 3 };
  \node (4)[fill=gray] at (0,0) { 4 };
  \node (5) at (1,0) { 5 };
  \node (6)[fill=gray] at (2,0) { 6 };
  \node (7) at (3,0) { 7 };

  \draw[-] (1) edge (2);
  \draw[-] (1) edge (3);
  \draw[-] (2) edge (4);
  \draw[-] (2) edge (5);
  \draw[-] (3) edge (6);
  \draw[-] (3) edge (7);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{marginfigure}
The whole process ends when
every node in Bob's tree is marked.



We study 3 random processes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each round, Alice sends the name of a node independently and
  uniformly at random from $\{1,\ldots, N\}$.
\item Each round, Alice sends the name of a node uniformly at
  random \emph{from those she has not sent before}.
  Another way of saying this is that Alice starts by picking a random
  permutation $\pi$ on $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ and then sends $\pi(i)$ in
  round $i$.
\item Each round, Alice sends the name of a node uniformly at random
  \emph{from those that are not yet marked}. (Alice can see Bob's tree.)
\end{enumerate}


\emph{Hints:} For $R_2$ and $R_3$, you may be tempted to pick random
numbers uniformly from $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ each round and and throw away
those already sent. That takes too much time.
Instead, for $R_2$ start with a random permutation using the ``Knuth
shuffle''.
Look it up.

To understand what is going on, maybe it helps you to see which nodes
Alice sent. (In particular, what is the last node she sends before the
process stops? Statistically, what is the ``bottleneck'' in the process?)

  in your names and the parts marked $[\ldots]$.
  Remove the sidenotes in your final hand-in.}

\subsection{Results}

For $i\in\{1,2,3\}$, the number of rounds $R_i$ spent until the tree
is completely marked in process $i$ is given in the following table.
The table shows the result of $[\cdots]$ repeated
trails.\footnote{Report your empirical data for $R_i$.	
  Give each value as the mean plus/minus one standard deviation.
  Use whatever best practices for reporting data you may have learned;
  here's a crash course that suffices for our purposes: (i) Calculate mean and standard deviation ($m
  = 2.5074$, $s = 0.889341021813$) from a number of repeated
  experiments.
  (ii) Round $s$ to one significant digit ($s = 0.9$).
  (iii) Round $m$ to the decimal place corresponding to the first
  significant digit in $s$ ($m = 2.5$, $s = 0.9$).
  (iv) Report $m\pm s$ ($2.5 \pm 0.9$).
  (v) Use scientific notation.
  
  If you've taken too many statistics classes, feel free to go to town
  with graphs and confidence intervals and so forth.}

In the last column, report the expected value of $R_1$ for each $N$, using the formula derived from your theoretical analysis in the following section \footnote{Use more than one term when evaluating the formula, the result will hopefully be (surprisingly) close to the empirical data.}.

\subsection{Analysis}

Our experimental data indicates that $\mathbf E [R_1]$ is [$\ldots$]. Optional: $\mathbf E[R_2]$ [$\cdots$], and $\mathbf E[R_3]$
[$\cdots$].\footnote{For each of the tree processes, try to express
  the observed behaviour of $R_i$ using standard terminology from the
  analys of algorithms.
  For instance, use expressions such as ``$E[R_1]$ is logarithmic in
  $N$'' or ``$E[R_2]$ is somewhere between $\Omega(N^{1/2})$ and
  $\Omega(N^{3/2})$''.}

Theoretically, the behaviour of $R_1$ can be explained as follows: [$\cdots$] \footnote{This
  is the difficult part.
  You need to write a few lines that explain the random process
  underlying $R_1$ and derive an expression for $\mathbf E[R_1]$.

  \emph{Hint:} If you're stuck at $R_1$, do the following experiment
  as a warmup.
  Process $0$ is like process $1$, except that Bob doesn't use his
  marking rules: the only nodes that get marked are those sent by
  Alice. Implement this (it's easy) and analyse the behaviour both
  theoretically and practically.  

  \emph{Hint 2:} Still stuck at $R_1$? Draw sketches of the tree in the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. We're interested in the ending phase, can you make any assumptions to simplify the problem? 
   
  \emph{Optional:} Explain the
  behaviours of $R_2$ and $R_3$ as well.
  The behaviour of $R_2$ is quite a bit harder; while $R_3$ is just
  cute.

\section{Perspective}

This lab establishes minimal skills in simulation of random processes,
introduces the Knuth shuffle for those who haven't seen it, and some
basic probability theory about occupancy problems.
In process 2, Alice's messages are not independent, which can lead to
temping errors in the analysis.
Process 3 is just surprising (and maybe fun to implement), but not
much about randomness is to be learned from it.

The exercise is built on an assigment of Michael
Mitzenmacher.\sidenote{Michael Mitzenmacher, An Experimental
  Assignment on Random Processes, SIGACT News, 27 December 2000.
